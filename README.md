## Cyber-Watchdog-Agent
Cyber Watchdog Agent is a lightweight cybersecurity assistant that helps detect potentially phishing or unsafe URLs before users fall into traps.
It combines simple heuristics (like checking for IP addresses in domains, suspicious keywords, and redirection behavior) with basic ML-based classification to determine whether a link or text looks Safe or Unsafe.

# The project provides:

🛡️ Real-time classification of text/URLs

🌐 Summaries in both English and Nepali for accessibility

⚙️ Expandable technical details for developers, researchers, and security learners

# This makes it useful for:

Students & researchers learning about phishing and safe-browsing systems

Cybersecurity hobbyists who want to analyze suspicious links

Developers who wish to integrate phishing detection into their applications
